## Challenges
One of the biggest challenges that I faced was crossing off the tasks from the todo lists. While I was able to check off the first item on the todo list and update the date model to indicate that the task was comlete, I could not cross off the remaining tasks. I really struggled to access the individual ID's associated with each button and task with out breaking existing code. 

## Wins
I was happy that I was able to navigate the local storage to make the todo lists persist. When I crossed off the first task on my todo list I was able to update the date model to indicate that the task was completed.
